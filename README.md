Ever daydreamed about having your own Invisibility Cloak, a la Harry Potter? Well, guess what? Your magical dreams just got a tech upgrade! 🚀✨ This project brings the magic of disappearing acts to the real world using the mystical powers of OpenCV. ✨ 
### Test it out on yourself on - https://invisibility-cloak-ishaangupta1201.streamlit.app/

## Fun Fact
This invisibility cloak wasn't brewed up in Snape's dungeon but cooked up during the "I'm bored in my second-semester summer" phase of 2020. Forget the Marauder's Map; we've got the Coder's Cloak now, revealing only what you want it to! 🕵️‍♂️✨

# How to Use?
1. Visit the link https://invisibility-cloak-ishaangupta1201.streamlit.app/
2. Choose your camera device and click on start.
3. After clicking start, wait for 2-3 seconds to allow the system to capture the background. (During this time, avoid being in front of the camera and prefer a static, non-movement background.)
4. Now, hold a red cloth in front of you and stand in front of the camera.
### That's it. Yer a wizard, too now! 🪄
